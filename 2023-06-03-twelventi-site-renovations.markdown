If you're a fan of the twelventi blog, you might notice some of the things around here have changed. I've realized that I advertise that I know React/TypeScript, but have zero examples on GitHub to prove how I do. Secondly, the GitHub pages version of Jekyll that I previously used for this technical blog has rotted, the version they have to render pages is no longer the most up to date, and it just gets confusing dealing with Ruby Gems and Bundler (however it's probably not correct to say that the JavaScript ecosystem is any less confusing). You can check out the repo [here](https://github.com/twelventi/twelventi-dot-com) if you'd like to take a look at my code.


If you're here for a while, you might notice some other country flags flying around the screen and following your cursor. Whenever someone connects to the site, the flag of the country they are visiting from follows around their cursor, and displays to other users on the site! (Pretty cool, say hi!). If you'd like to disable this behavior you always can click the cursor icon in the navbar.

That's all for now, I plan to have some more blog posts soon about various things I've been working on so stay tuned!
